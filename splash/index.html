            <img id="imagesBar" src="images\DJLogo.png">
              <p class="paragraph">A native of Greenville, South Carolina. Jamar Nelson, formerly known by his moniker DjAquafina. DjAquafina has gained intellect in various stages of what it takes for an artist to thrive. You might be asking what abilities does the "Mr. Splash" have? He is known for being a Dj on the weekend, a Producer in his free time, an Audio Engineer, a Graphic Artist, and so much More. My production skills involve composing, arranging, and recording various elements such as melodies, harmonies, and rhythms, and my mixing skills involve balancing the levels of these elements and adding effects to create a cohesive final product. My mastering skills involve adjusting the overall volume and EQ of the track to meet industry standards and make it sound professional.
<br>
<br>
                Having these skills has given me greater control over the creative process and the ability to produce music that sounds exactly how I envision it. It has also made me more competitive in the music industry, as many jobs in the field require knowledge of production and mixing techniques. Additionally, being able to produce and mix my own music has saved me time and money by eliminating the need to hire outside professionals for these tasks.
<br>
<br>
                I have gained my knowledge in these areas through a combination of online tutorials, college courses, workshops, and hands-on experience. I also have access to good quality equipment and software, and have sought guidance and feedback from experienced professionals. Through practice and experimentation, I have continued to improve my skills and develop my own unique style. I am confident in my ability to produce, mix, and master music to a high standard.</p>
